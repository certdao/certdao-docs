# *certDAO* currently does **not** have a token.

However, a token is planned for the future whose **initial** distribution will be used to:

1. Incentivize contract owners to register their contract with *certDAO*.
2. Incentivize  wallet/interface developers to integrate *certDAO* into their wallet.

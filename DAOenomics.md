# DAOenomics

***certDAO* currently does not have a token.**

### Fees
*certDAO* currently earns fees from contract owners who register their contract with *certDAO*.

Also any updates to the registration made by the owner also incurs a fee.

This fee helps maintain the DAO and prevent spam.

### Token
However, a token is planned for the future whose **initial** distribution will be used to:

1. Incentivize contract owners to register their contract with _certDAO_.
2. Incentivize wallet/interface developers to integrate _certDAO_ into their wallet.
3. Incentivize future decentralization of the verification process.
4. Maintain the long term sustainability of the DAO.

# Overview

*certDAO* is a decentralized autonomous organization that verifies domain to contract address mappings for the Ethereum community. Think of *certDAO* as a certificate authority for Web3.
### What *certDAO* is

- A way for users to verify that a smart contract is the intended contract for a given domain by the contract owner and not a malicious actor.

- A way for the community to flag malicious smart contracts on domains (hosts) and that information be read by all interested parties (wallets/interfaces) in a decentralized manner.

- A way to help prevent phishing attacks on the Web3 community.

- A way to help prevent frontend exploits on the Web3 community.

- A way to create a common standard/interface to be used by wallets and interfaces to verify that a contract is the intended contract for a given domain when navigated to by the user.

### What *certDAO* is **not**

- A smart contract auditing service.

- A way to enforce an outside regulatory framework on smart contracts*.

*flagging a contract as malicious does **not** mean that the contract is illegal or violates any regulatory framework. It simply means that the contract does something outside of what the site promises/user intends to happen.
